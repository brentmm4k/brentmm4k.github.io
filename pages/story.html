      <h2>Story Page</h2>
      <p>Although Super Smash Bros. is usually viewed as a online fighting game or a party game, all of its games have a campaign mode that adds extra content and stories to the world of Smash Bros, the problem is that the opinions of how the timeline and how the storylines flow differ from one person to another, however I was able to find a Reddit post which I believe is the most credible and sensible explanation of the story of Super Smash Bros.</p><br>
      <p>The lore of Smash is quite vague and left up to a lot of personal interpretation. The most common interpretation, though, is that each game follows the life of a creator. Smash 64 establishes that the playable characters are toys and that the fights between the characters are just from a child's imagination. Master Hand, the final boss of Smash 64, simply represents the child themselves fighting the playable characters.</p><br>
        <div class="story-container"><img src="/images/64.png" alt="64"></div>
      <p>Smash Melee, to my knowledge, doesn't expand the lore too much, but we can tell that the kid has grown up quite a bit. The introduction of trophies implies that the fighters of Smash are no longer the plush characters we see in Smash 64, but are now collectible figurines or action figures (this idea is backed up more in Smash Brawl when playable characters are shown turning back into trophies). This can be seen as the child maturing and growing.</p><br>
        <div class="story-container"><img src="/images/melee.png" alt="Melee"></div>
      <p>Smash Brawl introduces the character Tabuu in its story mode. Tabuu's name is pretty clearly a play on the word "taboo," meaning something that society deems prohibited due to culture or societal beliefs. Looking at the trophy room in Smash Brawl, we can see that the child has grown up quite a bit. It's likely that at this point, they're a young adult. This, along with Tabuu and the ability to "remove the life" from characters and turn them back to meaningless trophies can give us the assumption that Smash Brawl and its story is about a kid growing up and facing the taboo that adults shouldn't play with toys anymore. The Smash Brawl characters are clearly nothing more than action figures, but with the kid now being adult, society has implemented the idea in his life that he needs to grow up and stop playing, thus "removing the life" from the characters.</p><br>
        <div class="story-container"><img src="/images/brawl.png" alt="Brawl"></div>
      <p>This is not the common opinion, but I believe that the characters from Smash 4 (Wii U / 3DS) are no longer toys. The story that begins to be told here makes much more sense if the characters that we see are the characters from the video game "Smash Bros." That may sound a little confusing at first, but what I mean is that we're no longer playing with toys or action figures, but an actual video game itself. I think this is proven by Master Core. While the meaning of Master Core still isn't completely explained, I like the idea that Master Core represents the heart of the Smash series. It represents the imagination that initially brought the series to life, the dedication that kept it going, and the power the series holds. That is why Master Core comes out of Master Hand and Crazy Hand (which we've established represent the creator of Smash) and why Master Core can create characters that you have to battle.</p><br>
        <div class="story-container"><img src="/images/sm4sh.png" alt="Sm4sh"></div>
      <p>However, we can tell that Master Hand is losing control in sense. The forms it takes are sporadic and odd. Along with the way it bursts out of Master Hand, we can tell something is wrong. Eventually, after going through Master Fortress, which I believe represents holding onto something dear to you tightly, we rip Master Core out, where it is defenseless and weak. With all of this information, I like the idea that Master Core and the oddness around it represent the fear of losing control of your creation. Once it's been torn away from you, there's not much you can do but watch, which us why Master Core itself doesn't do much once it's out of Master Fortress.</p><br>  
      <p>Smash Ultimate has one of the more weird stories being told with Galeem and Darkrohn. You could really interprete it in a lot of different ways but I personally like the idea that Galeem represents Nintendo (Galeem being a heavenly angelic being and Nintendo means "leave luck to hevean") and Darkrohn representing the Smash community. I like this idea, because it gives the endings of Smash Ultimate some real meaning. In the first bad ending where Galeem is defeated, Darkrohn takes Galeem hostage and chained up, representing that if a community has too much power, the company that makes these games becomes trapped and creativity is stifled. In the second bad ending where Darkrohn is defeated, Galeem completely destroys Darkrohn and then washes over the universe with a simple bright white light, repressing that if a company gets too much power over the consumers, then products become dull and uninteresting.</p><br>
        <div class="story-container"><img src="/images/ultimate.png" alt="Ultimate"></div>
      <p>To get the good ending of Smash Ultimate, you need to balance both light and dark (aka, the balance between consumers and the product creators needs to be even) upon doing so, the spirits of Smash Ultimate are freed. The characters become their "true selves" in a sense. They are free to be what they should be as no one side has infinite control over them. There's a lot more to this theory too, such as how Galeem absorbs Master Hands for power (which represents the presence of multiple creators being used at Nintendo to make things) while Darkrohn keeps its Master Hands around (representing how communities are stronger in numbers). We can even see the "real" Master Hand at the end of Smash Ultimate, where we play as him, fighting against the fighters of both light and dark to maintain the balance.</p><br>  
      <p>Again, Smash's story is very vague. These interpretations may not be the right ones, so if something doesn't fit for you, you can always create your own ideas or mix other ideas into it. This is just how I view what Smash is trying to say and I know that these interpretations are commonly used. Apologies for the long post, but I hope I answered your question! I had a bit of free time, so I thought I'd give a very thorough summary.</p><br>
